Encapsulation vs Data Abstraction
Encapsulation is data hiding(information hiding) while Abstraction is detailed hiding(implementation hiding).
While encapsulation groups together data and methods that act upon the data, data abstraction deal with exposing the interface to the user and hiding the details of implementation.
Encapsulated classes are Java classes that follow data hiding and abstraction We can implement abstraction by using abstract classes and interfaces. 
Encapsulation is a procedure that takes place at the implementation level, while abstraction is a design-level process.
